<span class="markdown">
With the exception of the possibility for multiple parent classes, this ontology is at this point only a hierarchy of classes.  It should be noted that the hierarchy of disciplines is highly contested (i.e., many arguments about which discipline is the parent of what other disciplines), which is why the hierarchy given in the wikipedia article was used to define it. <p> 

The ontology was created for the U.S. National Science Foundation's EarthCube Resource Registry and gives each discipline a unique resolvable identifier, all collected in one place.</span>
